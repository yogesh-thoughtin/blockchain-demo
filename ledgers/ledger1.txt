Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving astrusted third  parties  to process electronic payments.   
While the  system works  well enough formost   transactions,   it   still   suffers   from   the   inherent   weaknesses   of   the   trust   based   model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannotavoid   mediating   disputes.     
The   cost   of   mediation   increases   transaction   costs,   limiting   theminimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,and   there   is   a   broader   cost   in   the   loss   of   ability   to   make   non-reversible   payments   for   non-reversible services.  
With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  
Merchants mustbe wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  
These costs and payment uncertaintiescan be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make paymentsover a communications channel without a trusted party.
What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trustedthird  party.    
Transactions  that  are  computationally  impractical  to   reverse   would  protect  sellersfrom fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.   
Inthis paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributedtimestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.  
Thesystem   is   secure   as   long   as   honest   nodes   collectively   control   more   CPU   power   than   anycooperating group of attacker nodes.
